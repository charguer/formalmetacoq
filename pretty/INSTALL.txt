(1) Download the TLC library.

    git clone https://gforge.inria.fr/git/tlc/tlc.git ~/tlc

(2) Compile the TLC library.
      
    cd ~/tlc/src
    make

(3) Configure the path to TLC.
    Assume the current path to be  ~/formalmetacoq/pretty.
    
    cd ~/formalmetacoq/pretty

    Create a file named "settings.sh" with the following line:
      TLC=~/tlc/src/

(4) If Coq 8.5 is not in your $PATH but in some other folder, 
    add also the line:
      COQBIN=~/softs/coq-8.5/bin/

(5) Compile the files.

    cd ~/formalmetacoq/pretty
    make
   
(6) Open the files interactively using Coqide

    ./open.sh CombiInterp.v &

# You can define your own path to COQBIN and to TLC by creating a file called
# "settings.sh" and placing the right definitions into it, e.g.
#
# TLC=~/tlc/trunk/
# COQBIN=/var/tmp/coq-8.5/bin/



# TLC=~/tlc/trunk/
# COQBIN=/var/tmp/coq-8.5/bin/



*) requires Coq v8.3pl3 (8.3pl1 and 8.3pl2 probably also work).

*) to compile all files, run
     make -j

*) to open one file interactively, run

*) if you want to use a local installation of Coq, 
   create a file called "settings.sh" in the current folder
   and define in it the path to COQBIN, e.g. by writing:
      COQBIN=/var/tmp/coq-8.3pl2/bin/
