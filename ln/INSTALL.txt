(1) Download the TLC library.

    git clone https://gforge.inria.fr/git/tlc/tlc.git ~/tlc

(2) Compile the TLC library.
      
    cd ~/tlc/src
    make

(3) Configure the path to TLC.
    Assume the current path to be  ~/formalmetacoq/ln.
    
    cd ~/formalmetacoq/ln

    Create a file named "settings.sh" with the following line:
      TLC=~/tlc/src/

(4) If Coq 8.5 is not in your $PATH but in some other folder, 
    add also the line:
      COQBIN=~/softs/coq-8.5/bin/

(5) Compile the files.

    cd ~/formalmetacoq/pretty
    make
   
(6) Open the files interactively using CoqIDE.
    (For proof general, you'll need to adapt the script.)

    ./open.sh STLC_Core_Soundness.v &
