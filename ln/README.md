Type soundness proofs:

- `STLC_Core`: simply typed lambda-calculus (STLC)
- `STLC_Ref`: STLC plus references and nondeterminism
- `STLC_Exn`: STLC plus exceptions
- `Fsub`: System-F with subtyping (POPLMark challenge)
- `CoC`: Calculus of constructions (dependent types)
- `ML`: ML types with references and exceptions and pattern matching

Other results on semantics:

- `ISK_Confluence`: confluence of the minimalistic ISK system
- `CoC_ChurchRosser`: confluence of the calculus of constructions (dependent types)
- `Lambda_ChurchRosser`: confluence of the pure lambda-calculus
- `BigStep`: equivalence of big-step and small-step semantics
- `CPS`: correctness of the CPS translation

Other files:

- `Lambda_JAR_paper`: companion to the JAR'11 paper "The Locally Nameless Representation"
