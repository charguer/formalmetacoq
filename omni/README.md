# Arthur Chargu√©raud's Archive of Omni-Semantics Developments

See the README.md file in the parent directory for installation instructions.

This folder contains formal developments around the omni-big-step and
omni-small-step semantics. These semantics are described in the TOPLAS'23 paper:
http://www.chargueraud.org/research/2022/omnisemantics/omnisemantics.pdf

The construction of type soundness proofs using omni-big-step and omni-small-step
semantics are described in the files `STLC_Ref_Soundness_OmniBig.v` and
`STLC_Ref_Soundness_OmniSmall.v` from the folder `../ln` of the present
repository.

The construction of a Separation Logic on top of an omni-big-step semantics
in described in the course "Separation Logic Foundations", Volume 6 of the
"Software Foundations" series. It is not reproduced here, only the proof
of the consequence and frame properties are established.

The files in the present folder contain proofs of the properties of the
omni-small and omni-big judgments, and proofs of equivalence with standard
small-step and big-step semantics. The developments are presented on a
standard, nondeterministic, imperative lambda-calculus.


Contents
========

Languages formalized:

- `Syntax`: syntax of a nondeterministic, imperative lambda calculus, and of the entailment judgment
- `Small`: standard small-step semantics
- `Big`: standard big-step semantics
- `OmniSmall`: omni-small-step semantics, and eventually and divergence judgment, and their properties
- `OmniBig`: omni-big-step semantics, inductive and coinductive, and their properties
- `EquivSmallBig`: equivalence between standard small-step and standard big-step semantics
- `EquivOmni`: equivalence of omni-semantics and standard semantics

Other files:

- `LibSepFmap`: a formalisation of finite maps, used to represent the mutable store.
